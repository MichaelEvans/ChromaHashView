##About

> Chroma-Hash is a concept for visualizing secure text input using ambient color bars
>
> Password entry can be frustrating, especially with long or difficult passwords. Secure fields obscure your input with •'s, so others can't read it. Unfortunately, neither can you—you can't tell if you got your password right until you tap "Log In".
>
> Chroma-Hash displays a series of colored bars at the end of field inputs so you can instantly see if your password is right. Chroma-Hash takes an MD5 hash of your input and uses that to compute the colors in the visualization. The resulting color pattern is non-reversible, so no one could know what your password just from the colors.

> See the [original web version](http://mattt.github.io/Chroma-Hash/) for a live demonstration, and a bit more explanation.
